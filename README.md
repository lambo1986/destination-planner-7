Simple app with CRUD interface for destinations.

### Versions

Rails 7.1.3

Ruby 3.2.2

## Setup

cd destination-planner-7
bundle install
rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
rails server
```

## User Story
Follow instructions [here](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/practice_assessments/practice_assessment) to complete **user stories 1 and 2**.

**Note:** This is a *practice* final assessment to be used in conjunction with Turing School's mod 3 backend program. 

This practice assessment includes 4 user stories, but the real final assessment will only ask for 1 user story, where students are tasked with consuming multiple APIs. 

Suggested practice with this repo, then, is to **complete stories #1 and #2**. Stories 3 and 4 are for further practice.
